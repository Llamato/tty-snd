# tty-snd
tty-snd (terminal sound, or \[t​ɪti s​a​ʊnd\]) is a modular system for creating, modifying and displaying audio streams in standard input/output on the terminal

Current modules:

name | description
--- | ---
tty-snd-wav | loads a wave file
tty-snd-fft | transforms a stream into its Fourier-transform
tty-snd-graph | displays a stream in a raylib-graph-window
tty-snd-peaks | finds the peaks in a stream and displays as if they were frequency spikes (formants)
